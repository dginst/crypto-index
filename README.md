# DGI Crypto-Asset Index

The DGI crypto Index is a volume-weighted index and is composed of the most relevant crypto-assets in terms of liquidity and qualitative criteria. Designed and developed by a heterogeneous group of professionals with significant experience and relevant expertise related to Financial Benchmarks, Cryptoâ€“Assets and Financial Industry, the DGI Crypto Index is intended to give to private and institutional investors a replicable tool that best represent and synthesize the Crypto-assets markets. This Benchmark is denominated in USD and it is simulated from 2016/01/01.

**Key Features:**

* use volume as resource for weight computation
* selected exchanges based on security, real-volume and law compliance
* selected constituents on quantitative and qualitative criteria
* designed to be replicable by investors thanks to the buy and hold daily solution.

## Data Download

The software downloads the daily crypto-asset data in terms of trade volume and price of the 8 selected pricing sources that proved to be reliable in matter of real volumes and legal compliance: 
BitFlyer, BitStamp, Bittrex, Coinbase-Pro, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, Pooniex. The Data of these Exchanges are downloaded through the REST API of the website https://cryptowat.ch/ except for itBit's data that are downloaded through the REST API of itBit website.
Cryptowatch, demonstrated to be a reliable data bank for Crypto-Assets; It is owned by the Kraken exchange and was founded in 2014 by Artur Sapek.

Because the Index denomination is in USD all prices from the non-USD  are reported in USD; to do so, all the daily relevant exchange rates of the  Fiat/USD pairs and Fiat/StableCoin pairs are obtained respectively, from the European Central Bank (ECB) Website and the data provider CoinGecko; these pairs are  later used to convert all the prices in USD.

All the Crypto/Crypto pairs will be taken into account at a later moment.


Is it possible to find the download functions in the utils/data_download.py file.


## Data Setup

Once the relevant data are downloaded, they're processed.  

# Index Computation

Is possible to split the index calculation in six main parts.

1) First logic matrix computation

  The first logic matrix has the role of a first scrrening of all the cryptoasset in order to decide wheter or not the single cryptoasset can be eligible, for the index composition, in a determined interval of time. The interval of interest goes from each start date of the quarter to the end date of the quarter itself; follows that the specified interval is the period of application where a cryptoasset can be cnsidered eligible. For the actual computation of the eligible cryptoassets is considered the period between the start date of each quarter and the day before the board day meeting of the quarter itself. Here the rule: if, for a single cryptoasset, one single exchange has traded more than the 80% of the total volume of the period, the cryptoasset is excluded

2) Exponential Moving Weighted Average (EMWA) computation

  The emwa is performed on the traded volume levels and with a moving average period of 90 days. The code takes the data frame containing the total daily volume for each cryptoassets (cryptos as columns, days as rows) and compute the daily emwa considering the last 90 days volume values multiplied per the relative lambda, and then summarizing them.
  The index uses a lambda that decraeses exponentially starting from a value of 0.94 and followuing the formula:

    daily_lambda = (1 - 0.94) * (0.94 ^ (index))

  where the index is the value of intergers in the range (89, 0).
  The emwa values has two different usages: the computation of the second logic matrix and the computation of the quarterly weights.

3) Second logic matrix computation

  The second logic matrix is the second and last eligibility check that is needed in order to achieve a correct and consistent composition of the index.
  The idea is to compare, for each crytpoasset, the aggregate emwa volume of the specified period and then find the percentage that the single cryptoasset has respect to the totoal sum.
  The first step is to leave out, for each quarter, the cryptoassets that has been eliminated due to the first logic matrix; then the code takes the emwa values for the period between the start date of the quarter and the day before the board meeting day, sum them for sinle cryptoassets and compute the relative percentage of each one.
  If the relative percentage of a cryptoasset in less than 2%, the crytpoasset will be considered non eligible for the quarter.
  back the % of the EWMA-volume of any single cryptoasset compared to the aggregate EMWA-volume

4) Quarter Weights computation

  The weights computation is performed for each quarter on the day before the board meeting day. 
  The first step is to leave out from the emwa dataframe all the cryptoassets that have been ideintified as non eligible with the logic matrices; done that the code simply find the relative weights of the cryptoassets ewma: these are the weights of the next quarter.

5) Synthetic Market Cap computation



6) Initial Divisor computation
