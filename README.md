## Implementation

# Data Download

The software downloads the daily crypto-asset data in terms of trade volume and price of the 8 selected pricing sources that proved to be reliable in matter of real volumes and legal compliance: 
BitFlyer, BitStamp, Bittrex, Coinbase-Pro, Gemini, itBit, Kraken, Pooniex. The Data of these Exchanges are downloaded through the REST API of the website https://cryptowat.ch/ except for itBit's data that are downloaded through the REST API of itBit website.
Cryptowatch, demonstrated to be a reliable data bank for Crypto-Assets; It is owned by the Kraken exchange and was founded in 2014 by Artur Sapek.

Because the Index denomination is in USD all prices from the non-USD  are reported in USD; to do so, all the daily relevant exchange rates of the  Fiat/USD pairs and Fiat/StableCoin pairs are obtained respectively, from the European Central Bank (ECB) Website and the data provider CoinGecko; these pairs are  later used to convert all the prices in USD.

All the Crypto/Crypto pairs will be taken into account at a later moment.
